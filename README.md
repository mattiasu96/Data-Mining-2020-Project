# DMTM_2020
Repository for **Data Mining and Text Mining Project** 2020 @ Politecnico di Milano <br>
You can find our [report](Data_Mining_and_Text_Mining_report.pdf) and [power point presentation](DMTM_2020.pptx) in this repository.

Code is organized by incremental numbers, so you can follow our reasoning process. 

# The project
The goal of the project is the predictive maintenance of air conditioning systems in electrical control units, operating next to telecommunications antennas. The provided dataset is composed by 2605 sites (control units), split in training set (2071 sites) and test set (534 sites) in a time frame spanning from April 2019 to Feb 2020 (10 months).

The final weighted recall (evaluation metric selected by the professors) we got is 8.5%. 

The company that assigned the project achieved a 23% using a better dataset, so the expected order of performances is lower than that value. 
# Final evaluation

Our final project got the following evaluation:
1. Performances: 6/9
2. Presentation: 9/9
3. Report: 9/9
4. Code Quality: 9/9
5. Speech: 9/9 <br> **Final Grade**: 9/9
