    "Sites are distributed on the national territory.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Tower**: responsible for the signal transmission. Each single tower can mount a different cell type (CELL_TYPE_X) which is the class of the radio transmitter.\n",
    "2. **Shelter**: small \"room\" that contains a set of equipments needed for the correct functioning of the tower and the radio transmitter cell. In this set of equipments there's the **air conditioning system**: this system is used to keep a constant working temperature inside the shelter, avoiding circuit/servers overheat.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **SITE_ID**: identifier of the site\n",
    "2. **DATE**: reference date of the sample\n",
    "3. **N_TRANSPORTED_SITES**: static feature of the single site. Indicates the **number of transmission dependent on the current sites**. For example, a single site (SITE_ID) can have N_TRANSPORTED_SITES equal to 10. This means that if the current sites fails, we will lose 10 (or 11?) transmissions overall.\n",
    "3. **CELL_TYPE_X**: type of the transmission cell. X is a placeholder for the real cell type (CELL_TYPE_MACRO,  CELL_TYPE_MICRO,  CELL_TYPE_MOBILE ecc...). There are different cell types which differ (for example) for the emitted power, frequency range ecc...\n",
    "4. **GEOGRAPHICAL_CLUSTER_K_x**: geographical cluster of the site based on its location. For example sites in different regions (Lombardia, Piemonte ecc...). \n",
    "5. **cat_sum_alarms_prevXd**: 9 possible categories of alarms. \"cat\" is a placeholder for the real category name, X is a placeholder for days. So we will have something like \"overheat_sum_alarms_prev14d\" which shows the number of \"overheat\" alarms in the previous \"14\" days. \n",
    "6. **cat_mean/max/min_persistance_prevXd**: statistics about the duration of the \"cat\" (remember, it's a placeholder) alarm in the previous X days. Longer alarms maybe are more relevant and/or problematic. Very short alarms might be a false positive.\n",
    "7. **skew_cat_alarms_prev14d**: skewness of each alarm type\n",
    "8. **kurt_cat_alarms_prev14d**: kurtosis of each alarm type\n",
    "9. **mean/max/min_w_prevXd**: statistical values for different weather conditions in the previous X (again, X is a placeholder) days. \"w\" is a placeholder for the weather type, for example \"sunny\", \"rainy\" ecc...\n",
    "10. **mean/max/min_w_f_nextXd**: same as above, but in the future. We're considering the next X days and not the previous X days. \n"
